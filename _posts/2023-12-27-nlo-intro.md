In Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), leading-order calculations are often insufficient. We must look at **Next-to-Leading Order (NLO)** corrections.

### The Virtual Correction

Consider the loop integral in $d = 4 - 2\epsilon$ dimensions. Using dimensional regularization, we encounter the gamma function:

$$\int \frac{d^dk}{(2\pi)^d} \frac{1}{(k^2 - m^2)^2} \sim \Gamma\left(2 - \frac{d}{2}\right)$$

### The Divergence

As $\epsilon \to 0$, the expression diverges:

$$\Gamma(\epsilon) = \frac{1}{\epsilon} - \gamma_E + \mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$$

This singularity must be cancelled by the real emission diagrams to obtain a finite physical cross-section.
